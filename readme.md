# Mandelbrot JS
This is a very simple Mandelbrot generator. I wrote this just for fun. Thanks [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile) for the inspiration!  
It uses the [math.js](http://mathjs.org/) library for the complex numbers (legacy) and [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/) for calculation and rendering (current).
