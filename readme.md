# Mandelbrot JS
This is a very simple Mandelbrot generator. I wrote this just for fun. Thanks [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile) for the inspiration!  
The current version uses [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/) for rendering and uses a shader for the calculation were each pixel represents a complex number.  
(An older implementation used the [math.js](http://mathjs.org/) library)
