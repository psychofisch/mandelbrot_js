# Mandelbrot JS
This is a very simple Mandelbrot generator. I wrote this just for fun and to try out the canvas object.  
It uses the [math.js](http://mathjs.org/) library for the complex numbers.

# Controls
As you can see there are no controls. The only way to interact with it is to change the code. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
